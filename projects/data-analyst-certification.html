<h1>Data Analyst Certification Project</h1>
<p>Website Sales Analysis and Optimisation</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing website sales using data-driven insights. The main objective is to uncover purchasing patterns, predict sales trends, and provide actionable recommendations for the website's owner.</p>

<h2>What datasets were used to achieve the objectives of this project?</h2>
<p>We leveraged four datasets collected from a real e-commerce website:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Events Data:</strong> Behavioral data describing user interactions on the site.</li>
    <li><strong>Item Properties:</strong> Two files capturing detailed information about product properties.</li>
    <li><strong>Category Tree:</strong> A dataset providing the category hierarchy of the products sold.</li>
</ul>
<p>All datasets were anonymized to protect user privacy. These datasets, originally from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/retailrocket/ecommerce-dataset" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>, were adapted for this analysis to ensure scalability.</p>

<h2>Data Volumetrics</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Events:</strong> 275,609 rows / 5 columns</li>
    <li><strong>Item Properties A:</strong> 2,520,259 rows / 4 columns</li>
    <li><strong>Item Properties B:</strong> 2,115,992 rows / 4 columns</li>
    <li><strong>Category Tree:</strong> 1,669 rows / 2 columns</li>
</ul>

<em>Note: A lighter version of the original datasets was used due to volume considerations.</em><br><br>
<em>Main problem: The data's were so anonymised that this affected the accuracy and quality of the analyses.</em><br><br>

<h2>Project Objectives</h2>
<p>The main objectives of this project were to:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Deep Dive into Customer Behavior:</strong> Uncover purchasing patterns and preferences to enhance personalized marketing strategies and customer engagement.</li>
    <li><strong>Optimize Sales Operations:</strong> Analyze sales trends to improve inventory management, pricing strategies, and the effectiveness of promotional campaigns.</li>
    <li><strong>Support Strategic Decision-Making:</strong> Provide actionable insights backed by reliable data to inform key business decisions.</li>
    <li><strong>Identify Growth Opportunities:</strong> Discover new market segments, popular products, and potential revenue streams to drive business expansion.</li>
    <li><strong>Ensure Data Integrity:</strong> Detect and correct anomalies in the data to maintain the accuracy and efficiency of business operations.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare for Advanced Analytics:</strong> Cleanse and transform the data to facilitate advanced analytics, including machine learning and predictive modeling.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion and Recommendations</h2>
<blockquote>
   "Ensuring product availability in high-demand clusters is crucial for optimizing conversion rates."
</blockquote>
<p>
    Based on the KMeans clustering results, user behavior can be segmented into distinct groups, allowing the website owner to focus on clusters 1 and 3 for targeted sales opportunities.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cluster 1:</strong> Prioritize product availability to improve conversion rates, as 40% of products in this cluster were unavailable during the observation period.</li>
    <li><strong>Cluster 3:</strong> Loyal customers present an opportunity for targeted promotional campaigns to increase purchase volumes.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    While linear regression provided insights, its predictive performance was limited for transaction forecasting. Additional variables, such as demographic or historical behavior data, may improve model accuracy.
</p>
<p>
    The Isolation Forest model, though promising for anomaly detection, requires further fine-tuning to reduce false positives. It can potentially help identify cross-selling opportunities or target specific user segments for promotional activities.
</p>

<p><strong>Key Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Use linear regression:</strong> To evaluate the impact of marketing campaigns on sales.</li>
    <li><strong>Leverage KMeans clusters:</strong> For personalized user experiences and promotional offers, ensuring product availability, especially in high-demand segments.</li>
    <li><strong>Optimize product availability:</strong> Improving stock levels for popular products is critical to reducing lost sales.</li>
    <li><strong>Implement Isolation Forest:</strong> To monitor and address anomalies in sales trends, with the goal of enhancing sales performance.</li>
</ul>
