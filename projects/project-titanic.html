<h1>Project Titanic</h1>
<p>Predicting Passenger Survival Based on Nationality, Class, and Gender</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This project aims to explore the survival rates of Titanic passengers by analyzing key factors such as nationality, class, and gender. The primary objective is to build a predictive model that combines these variables to forecast the likelihood of survival.</p>

<h2>What datasets are used in this project?</h2>
<p>For this analysis, we use the well-known Titanic dataset. This dataset includes information on the passengers aboard the Titanic, which allows for an in-depth analysis of the factors that influenced survival. Key variables include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Passenger Information:</strong> Includes details such as name, gender, and nationality (derived from passenger names or other methods).</li>
    <li><strong>Class:</strong> The passenger’s class of travel (1st, 2nd, or 3rd class).</li>
    <li><strong>Survival Status:</strong> A binary variable indicating whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).</li>
    <li><strong>Other Variables:</strong> Age, fare, and embarkation point.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Volumetrics</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Passengers:</strong> 891 rows / 12 columns</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Objectives</h2>
<p>The primary objectives of this project are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Predict Survival Based on Nationality:</strong> Analyze the impact of a passenger’s nationality on their likelihood of survival.</li>
    <li><strong>Explore the Role of Class and Gender:</strong> Investigate how class and gender further influence survival rates.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine Factors:</strong> Develop a global predictive model that integrates nationality, class, and gender to forecast survival.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>The next stages of this project include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Data cleaning and preparation (including dealing with missing values).</li>
    <li>Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key patterns and relationships.</li>
    <li>Building classification models to predict survival based on nationality, class, and gender.</li>
    <li>Model evaluation and optimization for better accuracy and generalization.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion and Recommendations</h2>
<blockquote>
   "The combination of nationality, class, and gender provides a nuanced perspective on survival rates, which can offer deeper insights into the dynamics of the Titanic tragedy."
</blockquote>
<p>By exploring survival rates through the lens of nationality, class, and gender, we aim to provide a fresh perspective on this historical event. The next steps will include refining the models and exploring additional variables such as age or fare to enhance prediction accuracy.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for further updates as the project evolves!</p>

<p><strong>Key Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Investigate additional variables such as age and fare to further improve model accuracy.</li>
    <li>Explore interactions between variables, such as gender and class, to uncover hidden patterns.</li>
    <li>Fine-tune predictive models for better performance.</li>
</ul>
