<h1>Project Titanic</h1>
<p>Predicting Passenger Survival Based on Nationality, Class, and Gender</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This project aims to explore the survival rates of Titanic passengers by analyzing key factors such as nationality, class, and gender. The primary objective is to build a predictive model that combines these variables to forecast the likelihood of survival.</p>

<h2>What datasets are used in this project?</h2>
<p>For this analysis, we use the Titanic dataset, which contains information on the passengers aboard the Titanic. Key variables include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Passenger Information:</strong> Name, gender, and nationality (country).</li>
    <li><strong>Class:</strong> Passenger class of travel (1st, 2nd, or 3rd class).</li>
    <li><strong>Survival Status:</strong> A binary variable indicating whether the passenger survived ("yes") or not ("no").</li>
    <li><strong>Other Variables:</strong> Age, fare, ticket number, and family relations on board (siblings, spouses, children, parents).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Volumetrics</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>titanic.csv:</strong> 2207 rows / 12 columns</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Objectives</h2>
<p>The primary objectives of this project are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Predict Survival Based on Nationality:</strong> Analyze the impact of a passengerâ€™s nationality (country) on their likelihood of survival.</li>
    <li><strong>Explore the Role of Class and Gender:</strong> Investigate how class and gender influence survival rates.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine Factors:</strong> Develop a global predictive model that integrates nationality, class, and gender to forecast survival.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>The next stages of this project include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Data cleaning and preparation (including handling missing values and outliers).</li>
    <li>Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key patterns and relationships.</li>
    <li>Building classification models to predict survival based on nationality, class, and gender.</li>
    <li>Model evaluation and optimization for better accuracy and generalization.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion and Recommendations</h2>
<blockquote>
   "The combination of nationality, class, and gender provides a nuanced perspective on survival rates, offering deeper insights into the dynamics of the Titanic tragedy."
</blockquote>
<p>The analysis conducted in this project demonstrates that gender, class, and age were the primary determinants of survival on the Titanic. Women and children, especially those in first class, had significantly higher survival rates, while men, particularly in third class, faced much greater risks. Nationality also played a role, though more indirectly, reflecting broader socio-economic disparities at the time. Passengers from wealthier countries, such as England and the United States, tended to have better survival rates, likely due to a combination of factors such as language proficiency, social standing, and access to resources. However, nationality was less significant than gender or class in predicting survival.</p>

<p><strong>Key Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Further refine models by exploring additional variables, such as interactions between age, gender, and class.</li>
    <li>Consider socio-economic factors more explicitly in future analyses to better understand the role of nationality in survival rates.</li>
    <li>Evaluate the historical and social context of the data to avoid misinterpreting the influence of certain variables.</li>
</ul>
